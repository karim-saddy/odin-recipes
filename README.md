In this project, I’m going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will have a main index page with links to a few recipes. It won’t look very pretty by the time I’m done, but that’s okay—this project is all about sharpening my HTML skills. Later on, I’ll 
come back to it and make it look better with CSS.
